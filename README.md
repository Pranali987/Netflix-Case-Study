# Netflix-Case-Study

## Problem Statement : 

Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service headquartered in the United States, offering on-demand video content over the internet. We want to use this data to help Netflix figure out what kinds of shows and movies to make and how to grow their business in different countries. We'll look at things like how many movies come out each year, compare TV shows to movies, figure out the best time to release TV shows, check out the actorsand directors, and see what kinds of content are available globally. The main goal is to give Netflix practical advice based on the data so they can make better decisions about what to show and where to expand their business.
